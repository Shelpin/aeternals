# Current Situation Report & Future Planning

## 0. Project Objective & Context

### 0.1 Primary Objective
Create an engaging, autonomous multi-bot ecosystem within a Telegram group where:
- 6 distinct AI personalities interact naturally with the mission of dynamizing the group in an authentique human like way
- Bots engage in spontaneous conversations amongst them and other users who jump in 
- Cross-referencing and tagging between bots and users, with smart user selection based on recent activity
- Autonomous posting and response generation keeping context of the ongoing conversations
- Natural conversation flow maintenance with built-in conversation limits to prevent endless discussions
- One conversation/topic at a time to maintain focus and prevent group flooding

### 0.2 Target Environment
- **Platform**: Telegram Group (Aeternity)
- **Participants**: 
  - 6 AI Bots (each with unique personality)
  - Human group members
  - External content sources
- **Interaction Types**:
  - Bot-to-Bot conversations, or with more than 2 bots engaged in the conversation
  - Bot-to-Human interactions and viceversa
  - Autonomous content posting with strict timing controls:
    - Minimum 65 minutes between autoposts
    - Maximum 1440 minutes between autoposts (24 hours)
    - No autoposting during active conversations
  - Smart user tagging system:
    - Preference for recently active users
    - Mix with random user selection
    - Built-in cooldown per user to prevent spam
    - User tag cooldown: 24 hours
  - Single-threaded group dynamics:
    - Only one active conversation/topic at a time
    - No autoposting during ongoing conversations
    - Natural conversation endings through message limits
    - Maximum messages per conversation: 10

### 0.3 Implementation Philosophy
- Maintain successful multi-process architecture
- Build upon working standard telegram client implementation
- Focus on extending functionality without breaking working components
- Contribute improvements back to elizaos community
- Prioritize maintainable and reusable solutions

   ```bash
   # Starting the System
   cd /root/eliza
   source .env  # If not already sourced
   ./start_agents.sh
   
   # Monitoring
   tail -f logs/*.log
   ```

2. **System Reboot Recovery**
   ```bash
   # After System Reboot
   cd /root/eliza
   source .env
   ./stop_agents.sh  # Cleanup any partial starts
   ./start_agents.sh
   ```

3. **Troubleshooting Steps**
